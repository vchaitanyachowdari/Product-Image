# Requirements Document

## Introduction

5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage
6. WHEN testing in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL run tests automatically on pull requests

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and feedback, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear field-level error messages
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement error boundaries to prevent app crashes

### Requirement 5: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data and interactions to be secure, so that my privacy is protected and the application is safe to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and implement security scanning
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS and CSP headers
4. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent XSS
5. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement proper data encryption for sensitive information
6. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods with proper session management

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast loading times and smooth interactions, so that the application provides an excellent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle sizes
2. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL compress and optimize images before processing
3. WHEN rendering components THEN the system SHALL use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to reduce redundant requests
5. WHEN loading assets THEN the system SHALL use CDN and proper asset optimization
6. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL achieve Lighthouse scores above 90 for all metrics

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and UX

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
4. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels and error announcements
5. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and progress indicators
6. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL be responsive across all device sizes and orientations

### Requirement 8: Deployment and DevOps

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment pipelines and monitoring, so that the application can be deployed reliably and monitored effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
